![Tuto_Shoot](Tuto_Shoot.jpg)

Your agents can move! In this next league, enemy agents have entered the field!

Thankfully, your agents are also capable of performing the SHOOT action.

In this game, agents can shoot each other with water guns. Shooting an agent will increase its wetness.If an agent's wetness reaches 100 or more, they are removed from the game.

The amount of wetness added to an agent when shot is equal to the soakingPower of the shooter. This can be refered to as damage.

However, that amount will be halved if the manhattan distance separating the two agents is greater than the optimalRangeof the shooter. The shot will fail if the distance is greater than twice the optimalRange, in which case no damage is dealt.

Enemy agents will be present in the list of agents in the standard input. You may identify them with the player variable. You are also given their agentId and wetness. The agents with a value player that equals myId are yours.

The SHOOT id action will tell an agent to shoot the agent with the given id. Each agent can perform one SHOOT action per turn.
