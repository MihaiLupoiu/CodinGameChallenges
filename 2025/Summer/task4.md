## Objective 4: Throwing splash bombs

![Throwing splash bombs](tuto_bomb.jpg)

Your agents can now run and gun behind cover! In this new league, throw splash bombs at enemies to deal massive wetness damage regardless of cover.


Agents will sometimes start the game with a number of splash bombs. The current amount of splash bombs for any given agent is given each turn in the standard input as the splashBombs variable.


Throwing a splash bomb is a combat action. Meaning it can be used after a MOVE action, just like the SHOOT action.


An agent using the THROW x y action will attempt to throw a splash bomb at the location x, y. Splash bombs can only be thrown at a maximum distance of 4 tiles away from the agent. They deal 30 wetness to the tile it lands on, and 30 wetness to all adjacent tiles (orthogonally and diagonally).

Victory Conditions
In this league, there are four groups of barricaded agents, one of which includes one of your own agents. You must eliminate all three groups of only enemy agents with your limited splash bomb supply. Shooting is disabled.
Defeat Conditions
You hit any of your own agents.
40 turns have passed.
Your program does not provide a command in the alloted time or one of the commands is invalid.
