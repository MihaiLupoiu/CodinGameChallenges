This is a league based challenge.

For this challenge, multiple leagues for the same game are available. Once you have proven your skills against the first Boss, you will access a higher league and extra rules will be available.

NEW: In wooden leagues, your submission will only fight the boss in the arena. Complete the objective specified in each league at least 3 times out 5 to advance to the next league.
 	Goal
In this league, move one of your agents to the coordinates (6,1), and the other to (6,3).
 	Rules
The game is played on a grid.

Each player controls a team of agents.

Objective 1: the MOVE action

Each one of your agents occupy a tile on the grid. They cannot occupy the same tile. Each agent has a unique agentId.

Each agent can perform one MOVE action per turn. By printing a MOVE x y action to the standard output, you can tell an agent to move one tile towards the given coordinates.

To assign an action to an agent, print to the standard output its agentId followed by the desired action, the two separated by a semicolon.

For example, the following line:
1; MOVE 12 3
will assign the MOVE 12 3 to the agent with agentId = 1.

You must send exactly 1 line per agent on your team.

Grid and agent data are provided to your program through the standard input. Further details in the Game Protocol section.
